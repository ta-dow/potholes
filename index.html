            This proposal imagines Montreal’s potholes as luxury diamonds, presented through the polished aesthetic of a high-end jewellery website. Cracks, cavities, and uneven asphalt are described using the same grading language applied to gemstones, transforming hazards into “certified” specimens with measured depth, edge clarity, and colour variation. When a crater caused by freeze–thaw damage is reframed as “refined,” the wording shifts perception, making deterioration sound deliberate and even desirable. The project uses that shift to question how easily language can elevate or disguise reality. At the same time, it critiques the City of Montreal’s reliance on surface patching rather than addressing structural road failures beneath. The scale of the pothole problem has reached a point where it feels both absurd and embarrassing, and by leaning into that tension, the website highlights how superficial fixes mirror the superficial gloss of luxury branding.
